VLSI (Very Large Scale Itegration)

EDA (Eletronic Design Automation)

---
#### CAD å’Œ EDA
    Sharpen C/C++ programming skill
    * Graph
    * Algorithm
    * Tree
#### Book
    + Synthesis and Optimization of Digital Circuits
        - Giovanni De Micheli , 1st Edition
    + Electronic Design Automation : Synthesis
        - 
#### Grading
    + Homework(About 5 ~ 6 assignment) 
        (85 ~ 95)%
    + Class interaction 
        (5 ~ 10)%
Most CAD problems are NP-Completeness problems -> We need heuristics
